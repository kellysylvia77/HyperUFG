# When Hypergraph Meets Heterophily: New Benchmark Datasets and Baseline
This is the official repository for the paper "When Hypergraph Meets Heterophily: New Benchmark Datasets and Baseline" (Submitted to AAAI 2025).
# New Benchmark Datasets
In the paper, we introduce 4 new heterophilous hypergraph datasets: actor, amazon-ratings, twitch-gamers, and pokec. You can find these datasets in the data folder. Note: These data have been widely used in semi-supervised node classification tasks. We construct hyperedge relationships by mining their co-occurrence information to make them suitable for hypergraph learning.
